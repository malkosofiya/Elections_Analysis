## Election-Audit Summary
This script can be modified in many ways and be used for any future elections to provide a detailed view of the results. For example, we can further explore our data and show how each candidate performed in each county. This can help to better understand voting patterns per county. Additionally, if the data set includes other characteristics such as voter demographics, the script can be broken further down and provide an even more comprehensive overview. For example, average voter age per candidate, voter gender percentage per candidate or voter ethnicity count per candidate all might be useful additions.
